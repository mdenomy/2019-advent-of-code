Advent of code in Perl

Doing the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in Perl to bone up on some old Perl skills and learn some new modern Perl techniques.

Specific goals

* Learn to write in idiomatic Perl (if that is even a thing), or at the very least settle on a style that feels right to me
* Learn some modern Perl techniques, including testing
